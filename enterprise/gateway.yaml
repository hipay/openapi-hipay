    The Gateway API allows you to get paid and manage orders and transactions.


    Please note: this documentation describes the Gateway API parameters and
    response fields and allows you to test the platform in real time.

    This page is to be used alongside the **[HiPay Enterprise Platform Overview
    documentation](/getting-started/platform-hipay-enterprise/overview/)**,
    which gives you more information and details on the HiPay Enterprise
    workflow. You may use both documents in parallel when integrating HiPay
    Enterprise.


    # Integration


    Choose from three types of integration to select the one best adapted to
    your business:


    ## Hosted integration


    HiPay Enterprise hosts your payment page on a secured site. With this option
    you can benefit from a single point of contact, adaptable payment pages, and
    the PCI-DSS standard. You can therefore outsource heavy security
    requirements that are related to payment acceptance.


    In order to use this integration, please refer to the **Generate Hosted
    Payment Page (`POST /hpayment`)** API service below.


    ## iFrame integration


    This is a hybrid solution in which the buyer remains on your website to make
    payment. In order to use this integration you need to generate a hosted
    payment page (as above) with a special template, allowing you to properly
    display it in an iFrame.


    For more information, please refer to the **Generate Hosted Payment Page
    (`POST /hpayment`)** documentation below.


    ## Integration via our API


    In this case, the payment page is hosted on your website, allowing you to
    have a unified, fully customized workflow. Please refer to the **Request New
    Order API (`POST Order`)** below for more information.


    Please note that if you want to execute transactions with credit or debit
    card payment products, you will need to tokenize card numbers beforehand by
    using the HiPay Enterprise Tokenization API.


    # Managing transactions


    Once a transaction is executed, you may need to perform operations on it,
    such as a refund, a capture, etc. To do so, please refer to the
    `maintenance` web service.


    You can also get all transaction details at any time by leveraging the
    `transaction` web services.


    Besides, you may need to be automatically informed when a transaction status
    gets updated. To this end, you need to leverage server-to-server
    notifications. For more information, please check the [HiPay Enterprise
    Overview](/getting-started/platform-hipay-enterprise/overview/#server-to-server-notifications).

    ## Authentication


    All requests to the HiPay Enterprise API require identification through
    *HTTP Basic Authentication*. Your API credentials can be found in the
    Integration section of your HiPay Enterprise back office. Most HTTP clients
    (including web browsers) have built-in support for HTTP basic
    authentication. If not, the following header must be included in all HTTP
    requests.


    `Authorization: Basic base64('API login>:<API password>')`

         This service allows you to **redirect your customer to a payment page
        (hosted by HiPay)** in order to proceed checkout. This service creates

        an order and returns a forward URL. This forward URL is dedicated to

        display a payment page with your CSS and validated payment products.

        After payment form validation, the checkout is processed and the
        customer is

        being returned to your website.


        According to transaction state and `authentication_indicator` parameter
        (see below), the customer will be redirected either to the accept or the
        decline page.


        There are two strategies for implementing this service:


        ### Hosted: Full redirection mode


        Once the payment page is created, you redirect your customer to it. Your
        customer is redirected back to your website once the transaction si
        executed.


        ### iFrame mode


        You may also display the payment page in an iFrame, in order to have a
        unified checkout workflow. To do so, you have to provide the `template`
        parameter with the value `iframe-js` (see below).

        This service allows you to execute transactions through API with no need
        to redirect your customer to the payment page hosted by HiPay. This
        service supports payments with credit or debit cards as well as
        alternative payment methods.

        In **order** to make a payment with a credit or debit card, a token must
        have been generated beforehand. In fact, this service cannot receive
        credit or debit card numbers in clear. Instead, you must provide this
        service with a token associated to a card number. Use the HiPay
        Enterprise SDK for JavaScript in order to generate tokens.

        If you need to make payments with alternative payment methods, you can
        use this service directly. Note that the use of some alternative payment
        products implies that you redirect your user to an external URL. In such
        a case, the `forwardUrl` parameter will be set with the appropriate URL.
        Moreover, the activation of *3-D Secure* also implies a redirection of
        your customer.

            **This parameter is specific to SEPA Direct Debit as well as credit
            or debit card payment products.**

            Electronic Commerce Indicator (ECI).

            The ECI indicates the security level at which the payment
            information is processed between the cardholder and merchant.

            ### Credit or debit card

            If the payment product is a credit or debit card:

            - `1`: MO/TO (Mail Order/Telephone Order)

            - `2`: MO/TO – Recurring

            - `7`: E-commerce with SSL/TLS Encryption

            - `9`: Recurring E-commerce

            A default ECI value can be set in the preferences page. An ECI value
            sent along in the transaction will overwrite the default ECI value.

            ### SEPA Direct Debit

            If the payment product is SEPA Direct Debit:

            - `7`: First transaction/one-shot transaction

            - `9`: Recurring transaction

            The Electronic Commerce Indicator (ECI) is used by acquirers/issuers

            to determine the type of transaction being processed. The ECI value

            should represent the source of the transaction request. That is, the

            environment that the cardholder used to provide the payment card
            details

            to the merchant. It is important that merchants set the correct ECI

            value during transaction processing to ensure that appropriate
            merchant

            service rates are received.
