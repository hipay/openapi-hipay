  description: |2-

    The Gateway API allows you to get paid and manage orders and transactions.

    Please note: this documentation describes the Gateway API parameters and response fields and allows you to test the platform in real time.

    ## Gateway API base URLs

    | Environment | Base URL |
    | --- | --- |
    | Stage | [https://stage-secure-gateway.hipay-tpp.com/rest/](https://stage-secure-gateway.hipay-tpp.com/rest/) |
    | Production | [https://secure-gateway.hipay-tpp.com/rest/](https://secure-gateway.hipay-tpp.com/rest/) |

    ## Authentication

    All requests to the HiPay Enterprise API require identification through *HTTP Basic Authentication*. Your API credentials can be found in the Integration section of your HiPay Enterprise back office. Most HTTP clients (including web browsers) have built-in support for HTTP basic authentication. If not, the following header must be included in all HTTP requests.

    `Authorization: Basic base64('API login>:<API password>')`

      summary: Creates a secure payment page which you can redirect your customer
        to, in order to proceed checkout
      description: |2-

         This service allows you to **redirect your customer to a payment page
        (hosted by HiPay)** in order to proceed checkout. This service creates
        an order and returns a forward URL. This forward URL is dedicated to
        display a payment page with your CSS and validated payment products.
        After payment form validation, the checkout is processed and the customer is
        being returned to your website.

        According to transaction state and `authentication_indicator` parameter (see below), the customer will be redirected either to the accept or the decline page.

        There are two strategies for implementing this service:

        ### Hosted: Full redirection mode

        Once the payment page is created, you redirect your customer to it. Your customer is redirected back to your website once the transaction si executed.

        ### iFrame mode

        You may also display the payment page in an iFrame, in order to have a unified checkout workflow. To do so, you have to provide the `template` parameter with the value `iframe-js` (see below).

      summary: Creates an order and a transaction based on payment details
      description: |2-

        This service allows you to execute transactions through API with no need
        to redirect your customer to the payment page hosted by HiPay. This
        service supports payments with credit or debit cards as well as
        alternative payment methods.

        In **order** to make a payment with a credit or debit card, a token must
        have been generated beforehand. In fact, this service cannot receive
        credit or debit card numbers in clear. Instead, you must provide this
        service with a token associated to a card number. Use the HiPay
        Enterprise SDK for JavaScript in order to generate tokens.

        If you need to make payments with alternative payment methods, you can
        use this service directly. Note that the use of some alternative payment
        products implies that you redirect your user to an external URL. In such
        a case, the `forwardUrl` parameter will be set with the appropriate URL.
        Moreover, the activation of *3-D Secure* also implies a redirection of
        your customer.

          **This parameter is specific to SEPA Direct Debit as well as credit or debit card payment products.**
          Electronic Commerce Indicator (ECI).
          The ECI indicates the security level at which the payment information is processed between the cardholder and merchant.
          ### Credit or debit card
          If the payment product is a credit or debit card:
          - `1`: MO/TO (Mail Order/Telephone Order)
          - `2`: MO/TO – Recurring
          - `7`: E-commerce with SSL/TLS Encryption
          - `9`: Recurring E-commerce
          A default ECI value can be set in the preferences page. An ECI value sent along in the transaction will overwrite the default ECI value.
          ### SEPA Direct Debit
          If the payment product is SEPA Direct Debit:
          - `7`: First transaction/one-shot transaction
          - `9`: Recurring transaction

            To indicate the preference for a frictionless flow during the authentication 
            request, the merchant may send the sca_preference parameter. Depending on the 
            merchant's assessment of the risk of fraud, specific values may be sent. This 
            parameter can only be used by merchants who have a fraud risk assessment mechanism 
            of their own and who have subscribed to the SCA Preference merchant option. Please 
            contact your account manager to request it.

            - `1` : No Preference. If you are not sure about the transaction's risk of fraud,
            use this value. Using this value for all your transactions may result in a high 
            strong customer authentication rate.

            - `2` : No Challenge. If you think this transaction is safe. This will tell the 
            acquirer a frictionless flow is preferred.

            - `3` : Challenge Requested. If you think this transaction may be at risk, use 
            this value. This will tell the acquirer that a strong customer authentication may
            be required, depending on the PSD2 specific information you sent along with the 
            transaction.

            Electronic Commerce Indicator (ECI).

            The Electronic Commerce Indicator (ECI) is used by acquirers/issuers
            to determine the type of transaction being processed. The ECI value
            should represent the source of the transaction request. That is, the
            environment that the cardholder used to provide the payment card details
            to the merchant. It is important that merchants set the correct ECI
            value during transaction processing to ensure that appropriate merchant
            service rates are received.
