  title: HiPay Enterprise Finance API
  description: |

    When using HiPay Enterprise, all your sales are consolidated and settled (transferred to your bank account).
    The Finance API allows you to get all the details about settlements executed for your merchant account.

    # Integration
    The `settlement` endpoint allows you to either consult the whole list of settlements or search for particular settlements by amount or date.
    You can get the total amount which has been transferred to your bank account as well as the total sales amount, refunds, fees and chargebacks for each settlement by using the `/settlement/{id}` endpoint.
    You may also download settlement files in spreadsheet formats (xls, csv) or plain text by leveraging the `/settlement/{id}/raw{ext}` endpoint.

    Note: this documentation describes the Finance API parameters and response fields and allows you to test the platform in real time.
    This page aims to be used alongside the *Settlements* section of the **[HiPay Enterprise Platform Overview documentation](/getting-started/platform-hipay-enterprise/overview/#settlements)**, which gives you more information and details on the HiPay Enterprise workflow. You may use both documentations in parallel when integrating HiPay Enterprise.

    ## Authentication

    All requests to HiPay Enterprise API require you to authenticate using the HTTP *Basic Authentication* to convey your identity. Your API credentials can be found in your HiPay Enterprise back office in the Integration section. Most HTTP clients (including web-browsers) have built-in support for HTTP Basic Authentication. If not, the following header must be included in all HTTP requests.

    `Authorization: Basic base64("<API login>:<API password>")`

        This endpoint allows you to get the whole list of settlements for the merchant account you're authenticated with.
        The results are paginated, which means that not all the settlements are returned in one API call. Check the `page` and `per_page` parameters for more information about pagination.

        You may need to search for particular settlements. To this end, this endpoint also offers filtering parameters which allow you to get settlements for a specific amount and currency or in a specific date range.
        Check out the `amount`, `currency`, `date_from` and `date_to` parameters for more information about filtering capabilities.
