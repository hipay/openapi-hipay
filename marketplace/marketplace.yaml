  title: HiPay Marketplace API
  description: |

    The implementation of HiPay Marketplace involves establishing connections between your marketplace platform and HiPay based on a simple integration through a set of APIs.

    ## Account creation:

      1) The agent checks the e-mail availability with the [Is-available API.](#/user-account/post_user-account_is-available)

      2) The agent creates a HiPay account for merchants using the [User-account API.](#/user-account/post_user-account)

      3) The agent sends us the account number and the identification/KYC information using the [Identification API.](#/identification/post_Identification) HiPay validates the identification/KYC information within three days and sends the agent a notification confirming that the merchant is fully operational.

    ## Bank account information submission:

    Please note that it is possible to submit bank account information any time between account creation and withdrawal requests.
    To register a HiPay account bank information, use the [Bank-info API.](#/bank-info/post_user-account)

    ## Fund allocation:

    HiPay suggests performing fund allocation and withdrawal all at once. All the funds are held in escrow before being deposited on the technical account.
    The Transfer API is then used to allocate funds from the technical account to the merchants’ accounts. Try now the [Transfer POST API.](#/transfer/post_transfer)

    The Transfer API allows transfer requests to be made on the agent’s behalf or on the behalf of a third party.
    The technical account is therefore a monitoring tool that provides a clear view of fund allocation (fund remittance, refunds, chargebacks).

    ## Withdrawal requests:

    Once funds are allocated, there are two withdrawal possibilities:

      - Whenever a transaction is made – please note that this option is not recommended by HiPay,
      - Whenever a withdrawal request is made – for example, every ten days, depending on the agent.

    When agents want to do a withdrawal, they need to check the merchant’s account balance with the [Balance API.](#/balance/get_user-account)

      - In case of a zero balance, funds can be allocated with the [Transfer API](#/transfer/post_transfer).
      - If the balance equals the amount of the allocated funds, a fund withdrawal request can be made with the [Withdrawal API](#/withdrawal/post_withdrawal). (The Withdrawal API allows for a withdrawal request to transfer money to the merchant’s bank account and also to the partner’s bank account.)
      - There must be a zero balance in the end.

    ## Marketplace live testing:

    This documentation describes the Marketplace API parameters and response fields and allows you to test the platform in real time.
    This page is to be used along with the **[HiPay Marketplace Platform Overview documentation](/getting-started/platform-hipay-marketplace/overview/)**, which gives you more information and details on the HiPay Enterprise workflow. You may use both documentations in parallel when integrating HiPay Enterprise.

    ## Marketplace API base URLs:

    | Environment | Base URL |
    | --- | --- |
    | Test | https://test-merchant.hipaywallet.com/api/ |
    | Production | https://merchant.hipaywallet.com/api/ |

    ## Authentication:

    All requests to the HiPay Marketplace API require you to authenticate yourself using the HTTP *Basic Authentication* to convey your identity. Your API credentials can be found in [your Test HiPay Professional back office](https://test-merchant.hipaywallet.com/login). Most HTTP clients (including web browsers) have built-in support for HTTP Basic Authentication. If not, the following header must be included in all HTTP requests.

    `Authorization: Basic base64("<API login>:<API password>")`

        ### Information
        Allows you to transfer funds from a HiPay account to another HiPay account. HiPay suggests performing fund allocation and withdrawal all at once.

        All the funds are held in escrow before being deposited on the technical account. The Transfer API is then used to allocate funds from the technical account to the merchants' accounts. The Transfer API allows transfer requests to be made on the agent’s behalf or on the behalf of a third party.

        The technical account is therefore a monitoring tool that provides a clear view of fund allocation (fund remittance, refunds, chargebacks).

        For more information, please read the [HiPay Marketplace Fund allocation section](/getting-started/platform-hipay-marketplace/overview/#how-when-to-use-our-apis-operational-apis-fund-allocation)

        ### Information
        Allows you to request a withdrawal from a HiPay account and transfer the funds to the bank account linked to the account.
        Once funds are allocated, there are two withdrawal possibilities.

          - Whenever a transaction is made – please note that this option is not recommended by HiPay.

          - Whenever a withdrawal request is made – for example, every ten days, depending on the agent.

        When agents want to do a withdrawal, they need to check the merchant’s account balance with the getBalance API.

          - In case of a zero balance, funds can be allocated with the Transfer API.

          - If the balance equals the amount of the allocated funds, a fund withdrawal request can be made with the Withdrawal API. (The Withdrawal API allows for withdrawal requests to transfer money to the merchant’s bank account and also to the partner’s bank account.)

          - There must be a zero balance in the end.

        For more information, please read the [HiPay Marketplace Withdrawal requests section](/getting-started/platform-hipay-marketplace/overview/#how-when-to-use-our-apis-operational-apis-withdrawal-requests)
