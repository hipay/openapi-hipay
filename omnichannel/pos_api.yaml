    ## Description
    The HiPay POS API allows you to trigger in-store payments by:
    - waking a point-of-sale (POS) payment terminal with the payment information (amount, currency, etc.)
    - creating the related transaction in HiPay Console, your dedicated management interface.

    *Please note: this documentation describes the POS API parameters and response fields and allows you to test the platform in real time.
    If you are looking for information about its integration, please check the [dedicated documentation](https://developer.hipay.com/point-of-sale/smart-terminal/pos-api).*

    ## Authentication
    The HiPay POS API relies on *HTTP Basic Authentication*: for every request, API credentials must be provided in the request headers.

    Most HTTP clients (including web browsers) have built-in support for HTTP basic authentication. If not, the following header must be included in all HTTP requests.
    `Authorization: Basic base64('<API login>:<API password>')`

    *Note #1: API credentials can be found in the Integration section of your HiPay Enterprise back office.*
    *Note #2: Only **private credentials** can be used to authenticate ("Accessibility" value = "Private").*
    ## Security
    For security reasons, it is highly recommended to filter access to your electronic POS payment terminals, based on the request origins.
    To make sure only requests coming from HiPay will be able to join your terminals, you can set up an IP packet filtering rule on your firewall based on the following IPs:
    | Environment | IP |
    | --- | --- |
    | Stage | 35.241.177.31 |
    | Production | 35.205.91.234 |
